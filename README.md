## Introduction
In this project I created the classic "Arkanoid" or "Brick Breaker" video game based on OOP concepts. 
The implementation includes various levels with increasing difficulty, usage of polymorphism, inheritance, design
patterns (decorator, observer), encapsulation, abstraction, and generic collections
data structures (linked lists, maps, etc.), all in a user-friendly GUI platform.
